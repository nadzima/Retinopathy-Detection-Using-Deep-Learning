# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect diabetic retinopathy, a medical condition caused by diabetes that affects the eyes, using deep learning models. By classifying retinal images into five categories of severity (No_DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Proliferative), this project demonstrates the potential of AI in helping medical professionals detect the condition early, even in remote areas with limited resources.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 3662 color retinal images labeled into five categories:
- **No_DR**: No signs of diabetic retinopathy.
- **Mild**: Early stage of the condition.
- **Moderate**: Significant symptoms present.
- **Severe**: Advanced condition.
- **Proliferative**: Rapidly worsening diabetic retinopathy.

The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle's Diabetic Retinopathy Detection competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data).

## Models Used
Two deep learning models were utilized to classify the retinal images: **ResNet50**

These models are well-known for their performance in image classification tasks and were chosen to serve as strong baselines for the detection of diabetic retinopathy.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Applied data augmentation techniques to increase the dataset's variability and improve model performance.
2. **Model Development**: Implemented ResNet50 and InceptionResNetV2 for classification. Fine-tuning was performed to optimize model accuracy.
3. **Evaluation**: The models were evaluated based on their ability to accurately classify images into the five diabetic retinopathy categories.
